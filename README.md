# BARS - BAT AGN Radio Surveys 
Radio data was acquired from the following surveys:
 1. The **1.4 GHz** data was obtained from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters [FIRST](http://sundog.stsci.edu/index.html). Images were also obtained from the **NRAO VLA Sky Survey** [NVSS](https://www.cv.nrao.edu/nvss/); [Becker et al. (1994)](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1994ASPC...61..165B) and [Condon et al. 1998](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/300337).
 2. The **3 GHz** data was obtained from the **VLA Sky Survey** [VLASS](https://science.nrao.edu/vlass); [Lacy et al. 2020](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/ab63eb).
 3. The **887.5 MHz** data was obtained from the **Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey** [RACS](https://research.csiro.au/racs/); [McConnell et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00747)
 4. The 144 MHz data was obtained from the **International Low-Frequency Array** [LOFAR](https://lofar-surveys.org/) using the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey [LoTSS](https://lofar-surveys.org/dr2_release.html); [Shimwell et al. 2016](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2017/02/aa29313-16/aa29313-16.html)
 5. The **87.5, 118.5, 154.5, and 200.5 MHz** data was obtained from the **Galactic and Extra-Galactic All-Sky MWA Survey** [GLEAM](https://www.mwatelescope.org/science/galactic-science/gleam/); [Hurley-Walker et al. 2017](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/464/1/1146/2280761). 
 6. The **22 GHz** data comes from the current BASS Radio Surveys. More can be found here: [22GHz](https://github.com/maconmagno/22GHz/)

Flux values were obtained by creating a region the size of the restoring beam and fitting it using Common Astronomy Software Applications ([CASA](https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php?title=Main_Page)). In the case of FIRST and NVSS, flux values and errors were obtained through their catalog search: [FIRST Catalog Search](http://sundog.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/searchfirst) and [NVSS Catalog Search](https://www.cv.nrao.edu/nvss/NVSSlist.shtml).

Image cutouts are provided, but we did not generate the non-22 GHz images. All cutouts were made using CIRADA Image Cutout Web Service ([CIRADA](http://cutouts.cirada.ca/)). 

This research has made use of the CIRADA cutout service at URL cutouts.cirada.ca, operated by the Canadian Initiative for Radio Astronomy Data Analysis (CIRADA). CIRADA is funded by a grant from the Canada Foundation for Innovation 2017 Innovation Fund (Project 35999), as well as by the Provinces of Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba and Quebec, in collaboration with the National Research Council of Canada, the US National Radio Astronomy Observatory and Australiaâ€™s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.
