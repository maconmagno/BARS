# BARS - BAT AGN Radio Surveys 
Radio data was acquired from the following surveys:
 1. The 1.4 GHz data was obtained from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters [FIRST](http://sundog.stsci.edu/index.html). Images were also obtained from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey [NVSS](https://www.cv.nrao.edu/nvss/); [Becker et al. (1994)](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1994ASPC...61..165B) and [Condon et al. 1998](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/300337).
 2. The 3 GHz data was obtained from the VLA Sky Survey [VLASS](https://science.nrao.edu/vlass); [Lacy et al. 2020](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/ab63eb).
 3. The 887.5 MHz data was obtained from the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey [RACS](https://research.csiro.au/racs/); [McConnell et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00747)
 4. The 144 MHz data was obtained from the International Low-Frequency Array [LOFAR](https://lofar-surveys.org/) using the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey [LoTSS](https://lofar-surveys.org/dr2_release.html); [Shimwell et al. 2016](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2017/02/aa29313-16/aa29313-16.html)
 5. The 87.5, 118.5, 154.5, and 200.5 MHz data was obtained from the Galactic and Extra-Galactic All-Sky MWA Survey [GLEAM](https://www.mwatelescope.org/science/galactic-science/gleam/).
