**Radio data collected from surveys over a vast frequency range. Our data comes from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey ([BASS](https://www.bass-survey.com/)). The native resolution of our observations is 1" (unless we observed in B-array, then it would be 0.3"). We also produce UV-tapered images with 3" and 6" resolution.**

Radio Surveys presented here:
 1. The 1.4 GHz data was obtained through the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters ([FIRST](http://sundog.stsci.edu/index.html), [Becker et al. 1994] (https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1994ASPC...61..165B))).
